# Amazon_HTML_CSS_Clone
Welcome to my HTML&&CSS Amazon Clone repository! Here, you'll find my rendition of the Amazon homepage, recreated entirely using HTML and CSS technologies. While this project currently only includes the homepage, it captures the essence of the Amazon shopping experience, complete with a sleek header design, dynamic product sections, and responsive layout. As I continue to develop this clone, I invite you to explore the code, contribute ideas, and join me in expanding this project to encompass more features and pages. Let's work together to bring the Amazon experience to life in the browser using fundamental web technologies. Happy coding!
